## Development Attribution

TroyonBetaNN.jl was originally developed under the FUSE project by the Magnetic Fusion Energy group at General Atomics.

## Citation

This package employs two pre-trained neural network (NN) models using different dataset and architectures: i) MLP and ii) CNN models.
If this software contributes to an academic publication, please cite it as follows, depending on the NN model used.
